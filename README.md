# Pomodoro Timer

Minimal React app (Create React App compatible) that includes the converted Pomodoro component.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm start
```

Notes:
- This project uses `sass`. If you already have a React setup, you can import `src/pomodoro.js` and `src/pomodoro.sass` into your app.
- The scaffold uses `react-scripts` so it's compatible with Create React App.
